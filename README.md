# Generating Real Time Adaptive Music for the 2D Platformer Cavyn
The immersion of players in videogames is greatly affected by the presence of adaptive music. This project delves into the generation of music in real-time using Markov chains, with the objective of dynamically adjusting the music to align with the current state of the game through the modification of note properties before their execution. Furthermore, unsuccessful approaches in addressing this issue are also examined and expounded upon, followed by the presentation of key findings and main takeaways.
